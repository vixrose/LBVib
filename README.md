Vibrate on low battery
## Details
Currently vibrates at 20% and 10% battery. May make the percent configurable in the future. Uses haptic feedback (at least on iOS 13).
## Compatibility
Should work on iPhone 5s and up and iOS 10.3 and up (maybe even lower?), but has only been tested on an Xs running 13.3.
